## Introduction
### 2.1. Definitions | Acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) encompass ==a spectrum== of conditions that include patients presenting with recent changes in clinical symptoms or signs, ==with or without== changes on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and ==with or without== acute elevations in cardiac troponin (cTn) concentrations (Figure 2). 

ACS = {AMI; UA}

Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with ==cTn release== and is made based on the fourth universal definition of MI.

UA is defined as ==myocardial ischaemia at rest== or on minimal exertion in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury/necrosis. It is characterized by specific clinical findings of prolonged (>20 min) angina at rest; new onset of severe angina; angina that is increasing in frequency, longer in duration, or lower in threshold; or angina that occurs after a recent episode of MI.
