## PRINCIPLES
### Background
Airway management is the cornerstone of resuscitation and is a defining skill for the specialty of emergency medicine. The emergency clinician has primary airway management responsibility, and all emergency airway techniques lie within the domain of emergency medicine. Although rapid sequence intubation (RSI) is the most commonly used method for emergent tracheal intubation, emergency airway management includes various intubation techniques and devices, approaches to the difficult airway, and rescue techniques when intubation fails.
### Anatomy, Physiology, and Pathophysiology
The decision to intubate should be based on careful patient assessment and appraisal of the clinical presentation with respect to three essential criteria: (1) failure to maintain or protect the airway; (2) failure of ventilation or oxygenation; and (3) the patient’s anticipated clinical course and likelihood of deterioration.
#### Failure to Maintain or Protect the Airway
A patent airway is essential for adequate ventilation and oxygenation. If a patient is unable to maintain a patent airway, patency should be established by using airway maneuvers such as repositioning, chin lift, jaw thrust, or insertion of an oral or nasal airway. Likewise, the patient must be able to protect against the aspiration of gastric contents, which carries significant risks for morbidity and mortality. Historically, the presence of a gag reflex has been advocated as a reliable indicator of the patient’s ability to protect the airway, but this has been definitively proven to be unreliable because the gag reflex is absent in 12% to 25% of normal adults, and there is no evidence that its presence or absence corresponds to airway protective reflexes or predicts the need for intubation. The patient’s ability to swallow or handle secretions is a more reliable indicator of airway protection. The recommended approach is to evaluate the patient’s level of consciousness; ability to phonate in response to voice command or query, which provides information about the integrity of the upper airway and level of consciousness; and ability to manage his or her own secretions (e.g., pooling of secretions in the oropharynx, absence of swallowing spontaneously or on command). In general, a patient who requires a maneuver to establish a patent airway or who easily tolerates an oral airway requires intubation for airway protection, unless there is a temporary or readily reversible condition, such as an opioid overdose. 
#### Failure of Ventilation or Oxygenation
Gas exchange, both oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide, is required for vital organ function. Ventilatory failure that is not easily reversible or persistent hypoxemia despite maximal oxygen supplementation is a primary indication for intubation. This assessment is clinical and includes an evaluation of the patient’s general status, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, and ventilatory pattern. Continuous capnography also can be helpful, but is not essential if oximetry readings are reliable. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are neither required to determine the patient’s need for intubation, nor practical to obtain before an emergency intubation. In addition, ABGs may be misleading, causing a false sense of security and delay in intubating a deteriorating patient. If obtained, they should be interpreted in the context of the patient’s clinical status. Patients who are clinically improving despite severe or apparently worsening ABG alterations may not require intubation, whereas a rapidly tiring asthmatic, for example, may require intubation, even though ABG values are only modestly disturbed. In most cases, clinical assessment, including pulse oximetry with or without capnography, consideration of the timeline of the patient’s respiratory emergency, and observation of improvement or deterioration in the patient’s clinical condition will lead to a correct decision.

The need for prolonged mechanical ventilation generally mandates intubation. An external mask device, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) have all been used successfully to manage patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure, obviating the need for intubation (see Chapter 2), but, despite these advances, many patients who need assisted ventilation or positive pressure to improve oxygenation require intubation.
#### Anticipated Clinical Course
Certain conditions indicate the need for intubation, even without an immediate threat to airway patency or adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation. These conditions are characterized by a moderate to high likelihood of predictable airway deterioration, worsening physiologic derangement, or the need for intubation to facilitate a patient’s evaluation and treatment. Intubation may be indicated relatively early in the course of certain overdoses. Although the patient initially may be protecting the airway and exchanging gas adequately, intubation is advisable to guard against the strong likelihood of clinical deterioration, which can occur after the initial phase of care when the patient is no longer closely observed. Patients with septic shock have high metabolic demand, myocardial depression, increased peripheral oxygen extraction, and vascular permeability. The combination of ventilatory fatigue, depressed pump function, and the need for directed fluid resuscitation predictably results in the need for intubation as pulmonary vascular congestion, hypoxia, and the work of breathing worsen. A patient who has sustained significant multiple traumatic injuries may require intubation, even if the patient is ventilating normally through a patent airway and has adequate oxygen levels. For example, a multiple trauma patient with hypotension, an open femur fracture, and diffuse abdominal tenderness warrants early intubation, even if the patient is initially awake and alert, without airway injury or hypoxemia. Active resuscitation, pain control, need for invasive procedures and imaging outside of the emergency department (ED), and inevitable operative management dictate the need for early airway control. In addition, a patient with penetrating neck trauma may have a patent airway and adequate gas exchange. Nevertheless, early intubation is advisable when there is evidence of vascular or direct airway injury, because these patients tend to deteriorate and increasing hemorrhage or swelling in the neck will compromise the airway and confound later attempts at intubation.

The common thread among these indications for intubation is the anticipated clinical course. In each case, it can be anticipated that future events may compromise the patient’s ability to maintain and protect the airway or ability to oxygenate and ventilate. Waiting until these occur may result in a difficult airway.

### Identification of the Difficult Airway
In most patients, intubation is technically straightforward. Although early EDbased observational registries reported cricothyrotomy rates of approximately 1% for all intubations, more recent studies have shown a lower rate, less than 0.5%.1 As would be expected with an unselected, unscheduled patient population, the ED cricothyrotomy rate is greater than in the operating room, which occurs in approximately 1 in 200 to 2000 elective general anesthesia cases.2 Bagmask ventilation (BMV) is difficult in approximately 1 in 50 general anesthesia patients and impossible in approximately 1 in 600. However, BMV is difficult in up to onethird of patients in whom intubation failure occurs, and difficult BMV makes the likelihood of difficult intubation 4 times higher and the likelihood of impossible intubation 12 times higher. The combined failure of intubation, BMV, and oxygenation in elective anesthesia practice is estimated to be exceedingly rare, approximately 1 in 30,000 patients.3 These numbers cannot be extrapolated to populations of ED patients who are acutely ill or injured and for whom intubation is urgent and unavoidable. Although patient selection cannot occur, as with a preanesthetic visit, a preintubation analysis of factors predicting difficult intubation gives the provider the information necessary to formulate a safe and effective plan for intubation.

Preintubation assessment should evaluate the patient for anatomic features that would herald a difficult airway. This includes an assessment for potential difficulty with laryngoscopy and intubation, BMV, placement of and ventilation with an extraglottic device (EGD; see later discussion), and cricothyrotomy. Knowledge of all four domains is crucial to successful planning. A patient who exhibits difficult airway characteristics is highly predictive of a challenging intubation, although the emergency clinician should always be ready for a difficult to manage airway because some difficult airways may not be identified by a bedside assessment.4

Airway difficulty exists on a spectrum. Some patients may have a single minor anatomic or pathophysiologic reason for airway difficulty, whereas others may have numerous difficult airway characteristics, complicating laryngoscopy, bag ventilation, use of an EGD, and cricothyrotomy. Although both sets of patients represent potential intubation challenges, the latter group, especially if obstructing upper airway pathology is part of the problem, more often has crossed a threshold of difficulty beyond which neuromuscular blockade would be avoided because a “can’t intubate, can’t oxygenate” (CI:CO) failed airway may ensue. In these cases, the preferred approach is to use topical anesthesia methods, with titrated parenteral sedation, to achieve intubation without the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NBMA). This is particularly true when intubation is undertaken with conventional laryngoscopy (versus use of a video laryngoscope or flexible endoscope) or when use of NBMAs would result in immediate physiologic deterioration and instability. Patients with refractory hypoxemia or severe metabolic acidosis may be intolerant to even brief periods of apnea. In such patients, an awake approach is preferred, particularly if anatomic difficulty coexists.4 Airways predicted to be anatomically difficult when using a traditional laryngoscope may not prove difficult when a videolaryngoscope is used (see later discussion). Occasionally, RSI remains the preferred method, despite assessment that the patient has a difficult airway, as part of a planned approach to airway management. This may include physiologic optimization, use of videolaryngoscopy (VL), and a double setup, in which a rescue approach, such as cricothyrotomy, is fully prepared for immediate use in the event of intubation failure. Regardless of the results of a reassuring bedside assessment for airway difficulty, significant challenges may be encountered with intubation and BMV, and the clinician must be prepared for unanticipated difficulty with every intubation.

#### Difficult Direct Laryngoscopy: LEMON
Glottic visualization is paramount in emergency airway management. With direct laryngoscopy (DL), if the vocal cords can be seen (Cormack and Lehane [CL] grade I or II view; Fig. 1.1), the chance of intubation success is high. However, when the glottic aperture cannot be visualized (CL grade III or IV), intubation success is less likely. Very few of the difficult airway markers thought to limit DL access have been scientifically validated, yet applying them in combination can provide a reasonable assessment of anticipated airway difficulty. On the other hand, VL rarely fails to provide adequate laryngeal visualization but may introduce difficulty with indirect tube placement. Characterization of difficult VL predictors is not well studied, and although mnemonics exist that attempt to cover predictors of both difficult direct and VL, the components are too broad to be clinically useful (see discussion later).5 Like DL, adequate video views are highly correlated with intubation success, although the strength of this association can depend on the device used and operator experience. Whether DL or VL is planned, a standard screening process for difficulty should be undertaken with every patient. Our recommended approach uses the mnemonic LEMON (Box 1.1), which has been shown to have reasonable sensitivity and high negative predictive value.6

==L—look externally.== The patient first should be examined for external markers of difficult intubation, which are determined based simply on the intubator’s clinical impression or initial gestalt. For example, the severely bruised and bloodied face of a combative trauma patient, immobilized in a cervical collar on a spine board, should (correctly) invoke an immediate appreciation of anticipated difficulty. Subjective clinical judgment can be highly specific but insensitive and so should be augmented by other evaluations whether or not the airway appears to be challenging.

==E—evaluate 3-3-2.== The second step in the evaluation of the difficult airway is to assess the patient’s airway geometry to determine suitability for DL. Glottic visualization with a direct laryngoscope necessitates that the mouth opens adequately, the submandibular space is adequate to accommodate the tongue, and the larynx be positioned low enough in the neck to be accessible. These relationships have been explored in various studies by external measurements of mouth opening, oropharyngeal size, neck movement, and thyromental distance. The 3-3-2 rule is an effective summary of these assessments. The 3-3-2 rule requires that the patient be able to place three of his or her own fingers between the open incisors, three of his or her own fingers along the floor of the mandible beginning at the mentum, and two fingers from the laryngeal prominence to the underside of the chin (Fig. 1.2). A patient with a receding mandible and highriding larynx is exceptionally difficult to intubate using DL because the operator cannot adequately displace the tongue and overcome the acute angle for a direct view of the glottic aperture. In practice, the operator compares the size of his or her fingers with the size of the patient’s fingers and then performs the three tests.

==M—Mallampati scale.== Oral access is assessed with the Mallampati scale (Fig. 1.3). Visibility of the oral pharynx ranges from complete visualization, including the tonsillar pillars (class I), to no visualization at all, with the tongue pressed against the hard palate (class IV). Classes I and II predict adequate oral access, class III predicts moderate difficulty, and class IV predicts a high degree of difficulty. A metaanalysis has confirmed that the fourclass Mallampati score performs well as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy (and, less so, of difficult intubation), but the Mallampati score alone is not a sufficient assessment tool. A Mallampati score necessitates an awake compliant patient to perform the assessment in the way in which it was originally described. Nearly 50% of ED patients requiring intubation cannot cooperate with this assessment, but it can be improvised by using a direct laryngoscope blade as a tongue depressor in obtunded or uncooperative patients.

==O—obstruction or obesity.== Upper airway (supraglottic) obstruction may make visualization of the glottis, or intubation itself, mechanically impossible. Conditions such as epiglottitis, head and neck cancer, Ludwig angina, neck hematoma, glottic swelling, or glottic polyps can compromise laryngoscopy, passage of the endotracheal tube (ETT), BMV, or all three. Examine the patient for airway obstruction and assess the patient’s voice to satisfy this evaluation step. Although obesity alone may not be an independent marker of difficult DL, it likely contributes to challenges in other areas of airway management. Nevertheless, obese patients generally are more difficult to intubate than their nonobese counterparts, and preparations should account for this and for the more rapid oxyhemoglobin desaturation and increased difficulty with ventilation using BMV or an EGD (see later).

==N—neck mobility.== Neck mobility is desirable for any intubation technique and is essential for positioning the patient for optimal DL. Neck mobility is assessed by flexion and extension of the patient’s head and neck through a full range of motion. Neck extension is the most crucial motion but placing the patient in the full sniffing position provides the optimal laryngeal view by DL.7 Modest limitations of motion do not seriously impair DL, but severe loss of motion, as can occur in ankylosing spondylitis or rheumatoid arthritis, may make DL impossible. Cervical spine immobilization in trauma patients artificially reduces cervical spine mobility, but DL is still highly successful in this group of patients.

A modified mnemonic, LEMONS, has been described, with the “S” referring to the patient’s oxygen saturation. Although not a direct contributor to difficulty with DL, a low starting oxygen saturation will result in a shorter period of safe apnea and a reduced time to perform laryngoscopy and achieve ETT placement. Some providers may prefer “LEMONS” over “LEMON,” but we consider oxygen status (and overall clinical status) a part of preintubation assessment that is distinct from difficult airway assessment. An alternative mnemonic, “HEAVEN” (Hypoxemia, Extremes of size, Anatomic challenges, Vomit/blood/fluid in the airway, Exsanguination, and Neck mobility) has been shown, in a retrospective review of aeromedical RSIs, to predict difficulty with both video and DL.5 However, the components of HEAVEN are a broad mixture of physiologic and anatomic attributes, some of which are either vague (anatomic challenges) or selfevident (blood/ vomit in the airway). The “HEAVEN” mnemonic lacks sufficient detail and specificity required to apply it at the bedside reliably, and we recommend use of the LEMON mnemonic. As noted, identification of a difficult intubation does not preclude use of an RSI technique. The crucial determination is whether the emergency clinician judges that the patient has a reasonable likelihood of intubation success, despite the difficulties identified, and that ventilation with BMV or an EGD will be successful in case intubation fails (hence the value of the BMV and EGD assessments; see Boxes 1.2 and 1.3).
