Created by Dr. Steven Lounsbury, PT, DPT, CSCS, CAFS Last revised 06.27.2022 The following exercises may be performed to increase your muscular strength and improve your cardiovascular endurance, with the goal of preparing you to successfully perform effective chest compressions in the event that you are required to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Exercise #1: Modified Push-ups To perform this exercise, start in the top position shown in the picture, with your hands shoulder-width apart and your knees on the ground. Tighten your core by squeezing your stomach, like you are trying to bring your belly button toward your spine, and then slowly lower your chest to the floor using your arms. Pause briefly, then push through your arms to return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times. Exercise #2: Triceps Dips To perform this exercise, find a stable surface such as a chair, couch, or bench. Start by sitting on the surface, with your hands to either side of your hips. Place your legs out in front of you with your heels firmly on the ground. You may keep your knees straight or bent depending on what is more comfortable for you. Slide your buttocks off the chair so most of your bodyweight is held up through your arms. Bend your elbows until your upper arms are almost parallel with the floor, then straighten your elbows and return to the starting position. Repeat 10 times. 1 2 AHA CPR/BLS EXERCISE HANDOUT Disclaimer: The contents contained within this handout, such as text, graphics, images, and other material are for informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Tighten your core by squeezing your stomach, like you are trying to bring your belly button toward your spine. If you are unable to maintain this position, you may also perform this exercise with your knees on the ground for a slightly easier variation. Be sure to not let your hips/buttocks rise into the air, and try to maintain a straight line in your back. Hold this position for 30 seconds. Exercise #4: Serratus Punches To perform this exercise, lie on your back, and lift either one or both arms above you to 90 degrees. Make a fist with your hand(s), then lift your shoulder blade(s) off the ground like you are reaching for the ceiling. Do not lift your upper body, the only moving part should be your arm(s). Hold briefly, then relax back down to the starting position. If this exercise feels too easy, you may hold a light weight (less than 5lbs.) such as can of soup in each hand to increase the challenge. Repeat 20 times.

Start with your buttocks resting on your heels, then quickly push your hips straight until your body is in a straight line, as pictured to the left. Be mindful to keep your chest up and your head in a neutral posture. Slowly return to the starting position. Repeat 15 times. Exercise #6: Jumping Jacks To perform this exercise, start with your feet together and your arms down by your sides. Quickly perform a small jump, spreading your feet/legs apart and bringing your arms up to the sides until they meet overhead. With another small jump, return to the starting position with your feet back together and your arms by your sides. If jumping is uncomfortable, you can perform the motion as “stepping jacks” instead. Perform for 30 seconds, twice. 1 2 1 2 AHA CPR/BLS EXERCISE HANDOUT Disclaimer: The contents contained within this handout, such as text, graphics, images, and other material are for informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Slowly try to bend all your fingers at once at the first knuckle, performing a small “waving” motion. Hold briefly, then return to the starting position with your fingers extended. Repeat 20 times with each hand. Exercise #8: Thumb Opposition To perform this exercise, sit with your arm resting on a firm surface. Touch the tip of your thumb to the tip of one finger. Hold for 3 seconds, then relax. Move to the next finger and repeat. Repeat 5 times to each finger, one set with each hand. Exercise #9: Hand Pumps To perform this exercise, hold your hand up as shown, with your elbow supported on a firm surface. Open and close your hand into a tight fist and repeat.
