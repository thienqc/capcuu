Although the HINTS examination was initially thought to be possi- bly helpful to identify the smaller numbers of patients who are suffer- ing from stroke or other central causes of vertigo, a recent systematic review and meta- analysis concluded that the HINTS examination, when used in isolation by emergency physicians, has not been shown to be sufficiently accurate to rule out stroke in those presenting with acute vestibular syndrome.8 This is in large part because using HINTS requires experience and practice, and it should be used only in patients with a first ever episode of constant vertigo from acute vestibular syn- drome, because this was the inclusion criteria in the majority of clinical studies involving the HINTS examination. For example, applying the head impulse test in a patient who is dizzy from BPPV would result in a negative test and may cause the emergency physician to incorrectly conclude that the patient’s dizziness could be from a central cause of vertigo and lead to additional unnecessary testing. In general, perform- ing both the Hallpike test and the HINTS examination on the same patient should not be routine. Instead, BPPV and acute vestibular syn- drome should be distinguished from each other by history and by the presence of spontaneous nystagmus. Thus, if the patient does not have constant vertigo, then the patient does not have an acute vestibular syndrome and the HINTS examination should not be used. Overall the lack of evidence supporting the use of the HINTS examination by emergency clinicians is not evidence that it should not be performed by emergency physicians but rather that emergency clinicians should have a low threshold for referral and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in those presenting with AVS and one or more stroke risk factors.8
