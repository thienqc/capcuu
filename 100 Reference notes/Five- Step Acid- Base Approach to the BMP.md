# Five- Step Acid- Base Approach to the BMP
*Trích sách Rosens*

## Step 1. Check for Abnormal Values
- `HCO3-` <22 => Toan chuyển hoá
- `HCO3-` >29 => Kiềm chuyển hoá
*(Bình thường `HCO3-` 22-26 mmol/L)*
## Step 2. Check the Anion Gap.
AG =  `[Na+]` − (`[Cl−]` + `[HCO3−]`)

## Step 3. If a Metabolic Acidosis is Present, Apply the Rule of 15

> [!NOTE] RULE 15
> Đối với `HCO3-` > 10 mmol/L, thì:
> - `PCO2` ước tính = `[HCO3-]` + 15 ± 2 mmHg
> - 2 chữ số sau dấu thập phân của pH = `[HCO3-]` + 15 ± 0.02
> Nếu:
> - `PCO2` = `PCO2` ước tính => TOAN CHUYỂN HOÁ NGUYÊN PHÁT bù hô hấp đủ
> - `PCO2` > `PCO2` ước tính => TOAN HÔ HẤP NGUYÊN PHÁT
> - `PCO2` < `PCO2` ước tính => KIỀM HÔ HẤP NGUYÊN PHÁT / TOAN CHUYỂN HOÁ
>  ---//---
>  Nếu `HCO3-` từ 5-10 mmol/L, thì
>  - `PCO2` ước tính là 15 ± 2 mmHg
>  - `pH` ước tính là 7.15
>  --//--
>  Công thức Winter: `Paco2` ước tính = `HCO3-` * 1.5 + 8 ± 2.

> According to the rule of 15, in an isolated metabolic acidosis, HCO3 + 15 should equal the Paco2 (±2 mm Hg) and the two digits of the pH following the decimal (±0.02). If measured Paco2 equals the predicted value, simple respiratory compensation for a primary metabolic acidosis exists. If measured Paco2 is less than the predicted value, there is a superimposed primary respiratory alkalosis on top of metabolic acidosis. If the Paco2 is higher than the predicted value, a superimposed primary respiratory acidosis is present.

> The rule of 15 has an important caveat. When HCO3 falls below 10 mmol/L, the rule of 15 loses validity because HCO3 and Paco2 have a nonlinear relationship. In cases with HCO3 between 5 mmol/L and 10 mmol/L, the expected Paco2 is about 15 mm Hg and the expected pH is about 7.15 (this is known as the corollary to the rule of 15). Alternatively, in these cases with `HCO3-` less than 10 mmol/L, Winters equation can be used to calculate a more precise expected Paco2: expected `Paco2` = `HCO3-` * 1.5 + 8 ± 2.

##  Step 4. If a Wide Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis Is Present
(Anion Gap ≥15), Check the Delta Gap.


> [!bug]- Show
> Calculation of the delta gap is used to identify additional metabolic acid- base disturbances superimposed on a wide anion gap metabolic acidosis. The delta gap explores the difference between the calculated anion gap and 15 mmol/L, which is the upper limit of normal for the anion gap, as well as the change in measured bicarbonate level from 24 mmol/L, which is the upper limit of normal for the bicarbonate level. In an isolated wide anion gap metabolic acidosis, each incremental increase in the anion gap is matched by an incremental decrease in HCO3 of approximately the same magnitude. For example, each 1 mmol/L increase in the anion gap above 15 mmol/L is expected to be accompanied by a 1 mmol/L drop in HCO3 below 24 mmol/L. A measured bicarbonate concentration higher than predicted by the delta gap calculation indicates a concomitant metabolic alkalosis. A measured bicarbonate concentration lower than predicted by the delta gap calculation indicates a concomitant normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.

## Step 5. If a Wide Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis Is Present
(Anion Gap ≥15), But the Cause Is Not Evident, Check the Osmolar
Gap.
