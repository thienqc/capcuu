## 16.2 Hypertensive urgencies and emergencies
The proper management of patients who come to the Emergency Department for BP elevation faces a number of difficulties. A major challenge for the physician is to identify and discriminate the patients at ==immediate risk of CV or kidney complications== from those in whom the BP elevation does not carry any immediate risk for health. While the former patients require ==immediate attention and treatment==, the latter are in no need of hospitalization or even treatment. FU and treatment of patients after discharge from the Emergency Department is still poorly defined and often inadequate [1116,1117].
### 16.2.1 Definitions of hypertensive urgencies and emergencies 
==Hypertension emergencies are conditions in which severe hypertension (grade 3) is associated with acute symptomatic HMOD. ==Hypertension emergencies, can be ==life-threatening== and require immediate intervention to lower BP, usually with ==intravenous (i.v.) therapy== [1117]. The rate of the increase in BP may be at least as important as the absolute BP level in determining the clinical severity of the situation and the magnitude of organ injury [1117,1118]. Typical clinical presentations of a hypertension emergency are:
1. Severe hypertension associated with conditions that need intensified BP management: ==acute stroke== (hemorrhagic or ischemic/thromboembolic), ==aortic aneurysm or dissection==, ==acute HF==, ==acute coronary syndrome== and ==kidney failure==. These emergency conditions are compatible also with a relatively modest BP increase, which is sufficient to precipitate organ failure.
2. Hypertension caused by ==phaeochromocytoma== or exogenous sympathomimetics substances (e.g. ==substance abuse==). Ingestion of sympathomimetic drugs such as meta-amphetamine or cocaine may precipitate acute and severe BP increases that may result in hypertension emergencies when there is evidence of acute HMOD.
3. Severe forms of HDP, including ==preeclampsia/eclampsia with a HELLP syndrome== (Section16.1 [1117]).
==Malignant hypertension== with or without thrombotic microangiopathy or acute kidney failure is a hypertensive emergency characterized by ==small artery fibrinoid necrosis in the kidney, retina and brain==. There might be also funduscopic changes (flame hemorrhages and papilloedema), microangiopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalopathy (15% of cases) or acute HF [1119]. Whether this traditional definition fully corresponds to the extent of the microvascular damage is still a matter of debate [1120]. ==The term ‘malignant’ reflects the very poor prognosis of this condition if untreated== [1119,1121–1123]. The Birmingham, Bordeaux and Amsterdam malignant hypertension registries have shown that malignant hypertension is rising in Europe [1117,1119,1124]. The emergency symptoms depend on the organs affected and may include ==headache, visual disturbances, dizziness and other neurological deficits== as well as ==chest pain and dyspnea==. In patients with ==hypertensive encephalopathy==, the presence of ==somnolence, lethargy, tonic clonic seizures and cortical blindness== may precede ==loss of consciousness==. Focal neurological lesions are rare and should raise the suspicion of acute stroke [4,1117,1118,1125,1126]. An acute stroke, especially ==intracerebral hemorrhage==, is associated with severe hypertension and has often been included among the hypertensive emergencies. However, it is an emergency that requires specific strategies to govern the BP reduction, because of the complex effects that its magnitude, speed and relationship with the existing BP level can have on the ischemic brain area surrounding the core brain lesion (Section 17.5). This condition should be handled by specialized (stroke) units.
The term ‘==hypertension urgency==’ has been used to describe ==severe hypertension in patients in whom there is no evidence of acute HMOD== [1117,1121–1124]. The burden of hypertensive urgencies is not well defined mainly because of the different criteria used for the definition of this condition. Furthermore, the ambiguity of the term ‘==hypertension urgency==’ versus the so called ‘==hypertensive crisis==’ has influenced epidemiological data [1116,1122–1124].

For patients with a ==suspected hypertension emergency==, the diagnostic work-up is shown in Table 23.

TABLE 23. Diagnostic work-up of hypertension emergencies and urgencies
**Common tests**
- Fundoscopy
- ECG 12 leads
- Hemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen, peripheral smear
- Creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes, LDH, haptoglobin
- UACR, urine microscopy for red blood cells, leucocytes and/or casts
- Pregnancy test in women of child-bearing age
**Specific tests**
- Troponin, (suspected HF and/or acute coronary syndrome) NT-proBNP
- Chest X-ray or ultrasound (pulmonary congestion and fluid overload)
- Echocardiography (heart failure, acute ischemia, aortic dissection)
- CT angiography of thorax and/or abdomen in suspected aortic disease (aortic dissection)
- CT or MRI brain (nervous system involvement)
- Kidney ultrasound (renal impairment or suspected renal artery stenosis)
- Urine drug collection (cocaine or methamphetamine use)

### 16.2.2 Hospital work-up, treatments and follow-up
==Hypertensive emergencies==, including BP >=170/110 mmHg in a pregnant woman, should be ==hospitalized==. Except for acute BP lowering in stroke, there are no RCTs on the management of these conditions. It should first be established, ==which organs are affected== to determine whether (i) they require any ==specific intervention== other than BP lowering and (ii) there is a ==precipitating cause== for the acute rise in BP that might affect the treatment plan (e.g. pregnancy). Then a decision should be made on the timescale and magnitude of the BP lowering as well as on the type of drug treatment that might be appropriate. Intravenous treatment with a drug that has a short half-life is ideal to allow careful titration of the BP response, keeping the patient in a close clinical area under continuous hemodynamic monitoring (Table 24). Rapid uncontrolled BP lowering is not recommended [4] and, thus, low initial doses with cautious dose uptitration should be used. Oral therapy with ACEis, ARBs or BBs (at low initial doses and cautious upward titration) is sometimes effective in malignant hypertension because the RAS may be activated by the associated kidney ischemia [1119]. Recommended drugs are shown in Table 25, and further details can be found in dedicated publications

Patients with ==hypertensive urgencies== do ==not usually require hospitalization==. However, they require BP reduction, which can be obtained by ==oral administration of antihypertensive drugs==, aimed at lowering BP gradually over 24–48 h. Oral treatment may include reinstitution or intensification of previous treatment or starting new treatment. ==DHP-CCBs are suggested as first choice== in an untreated patient as they have few or no contraindications and do not interfere with the diagnostic work-up for secondary hypertension. Sublingual, rapidly acting, administration of nifedipine should be avoided because the degree of BP decrease cannot be anticipated and may often be too fast and larger than desirable [4,1117]. Clinical surveillance in a short-stay observation unit is usually appropriate before discharge [1128]. As BP may remain elevated after Emergency Department discharge [1129], these patients need subsequent office and out-of-office BP measurements.
The survival of patients with hypertension emergencies has improved strikingly over past decades [1119], but these patients remain at high risk [4,1119,1122–1126,1130]. After discharge from hospital, when BP has reached a safe and stable level on oral therapy, an early FU and then frequent (at least monthly) medical visits and supervision by a hypertension specialist or a specialized hypertension center are recommended [4,1131,1132].
### 16.2.3 Blood pressure in the emergency department
==BP measurements in the emergency department usually do not follow guidelines== and may, thus, be inaccurate [4]. BP elevation is common, and hypertensive BP values in 48% of all patients referred to the Emergency Department during a 1- year period have been reported [1133]. However, the clinical significance of a BP elevation in the Emergency Department is not entirely clear, and available evidence is not univocal. ==In many patients, even a marked BP elevation is restored to normal when pain, distress and anxiety are relieved==, thus originating from an alerting reaction [1134,1135]. However, ==some studies have not shown a close relationship of BP with pain, stress or anxiety in the Emergency Department== [1090]. In addition, although in general BP values in the Emergency Department are not recommended for stratification of CV risk, an association of Emergency Department-measured BP and CV outcomes has been reported [1131]. In all patients, previous intake of some medications (e.g. ==NSAIDs==) or ==other substances that may cause a BP elevation== or ==oppose the BP reduction by treatment== should be searched for. If BP is not severely elevated and the clinical picture does not suggest a hypertensive emergency, unattended BP measurements should be performed with the patient alone in a separate quiet room because unattended BP measurements are usually not accompanied by an alerting reaction [95]. BP measurements should be repeated at intervals for at least an hour. Evidence is available that in 30% of the patients, BP decreases to grade 2 or lower values in 30 min [1128].
