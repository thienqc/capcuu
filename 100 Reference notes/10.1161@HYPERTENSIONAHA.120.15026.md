## 10.4 Hypertensive Emergencies
### Definition of Hypertensive Emergencies and Their Clinical Presentation
A ==hypertensive emergency== is the association of substantially ==elevated BP with acute HMOD==. Target organs include the retina, brain, heart, large arteries, and the kidneys. This situation requires ==rapid diagnostic workup and immediate BP reduction== to avoid progressive organ failure. ==Intravenous therapy== is usually required. The choice of antihypertensive treatment is predominantly determined by the type of organ damage. Specific clinical presentations of hypertensive emergencies include:
- ==Malignant hypertension==: Severe BP elevation (commonly >200/120 mmHg) associated with advanced bilateral retinopathy (hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, papilledema).
- ==Hypertensive encephalopathy==: Severe BP elevation associated with lethargy, seizures, cortical blindness and coma in the absence of other explanations.
- ==Hypertensive thrombotic microangiopathy==: Severe BP elevation associated with hemolysis and thrombocytopenia in the absence of other causes and improvement with BP-lowering therapy.
- Other presentations of hypertensive emergencies include severe BP elevation associated with ==cerebral hemorrhage==, ==acute stroke==, ==acute coronary syndrome==, ==cardiogenic pulmonary edema==, ==aortic aneurysm/dissection==, and ==severe preeclampsia and eclampsia==.
Patients with substantially ==elevated BP who lack acute HMOD== are not considered a hypertensive emergency and can typically be treated with ==oral antihypertensive therapy==.

### Clinical Presentation and Diagnostic Workup
The clinical presentation of a hypertensive emergency can vary and is mainly determined by the organ(s) acutely affected. There is no specific BP threshold to define a hypertensive emergency.
Symptoms include headaches, visual disturbances, chest pain, dyspnea, neurologic symptoms, dizziness, and more unspecific presentations.
Medical history: preexisting hypertension, onset and duration of symptoms, potential causes (nonadherence with prescribed antihypertensive drugs, lifestyle changes, concomitant use of BP elevating drugs "NSAIDS, steroids, immunesuppressants, sympathomimetics, cocaine, antiangiogenic therapy").

**ESSENTIAL** Thorough physical examination: Cardiovascular and neurologic assessment. Laboratory analysis: hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, sodium, potassium, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, urinalysis for protein, urine sediment. Examinations: Fundoscopy, ECG.

OPTIMAL Additional investigations may be required and indicated depending on presentation and clinical findings and may be essential in the context: troponins (chest pain), chest x-ray (congestion/fluid overload), transthoracic echocardiogram (cardiac structure and function), CT/MRI brain (cerebral hemorrhage/stroke), CT-angiography thorax/abdomen (acute aortic disease). Secondary causes can be found in 20%â€“40% of patients presenting with malignant hypertension and appropriate diagnostic workup to confirm or exclude secondary forms is indicated.

### Diagnostic Tests and Acute Therapeutic Management
The overall therapeutic goal in patients presenting with hypertensive emergencies is a controlled BP reduction to safer levels to prevent or limit further hypertensive damage while avoiding hypotension and related complications. There is a lack of randomized controlled trial data to provide clear cut guidance on BP targets and times within which these should be achieved. Most recommendations are based on expert consensus. The type of acute HMOD is the main determinant of the preferred treatment choice. The timeline and magnitude of BP reduction is strongly dependent on the clinical context. For example, acute pulmonary edema and aortic dissection require rapid BP reduction, whereas BP levels not exceeding 220/120 mm Hg are generally tolerated in acute ischemic stroke for certain periods. Table 12 provides a general overview of timelines and BP targets as well as preferred antihypertensive drug choices with most common clinical presentations. Availability of drugs and local experience with individual drugs are likely to influence the choice of drugs. Labetalol and nicardipine are generally safe to use in all hypertensive emergencies and should be available wherever hypertensive emergencies are being managed. Nitroglycerin and nitroprusside are specifically useful in hypertensive emergencies including the heart and the aorta.

### Specific Situations
- Sympathetic hyperreactivity: If intoxication with amphetamines, sympathomimetics or cocain is suspected as cause of presentation with a hypertensive emergency use of benzodiazepines should be considered prior to specific antihypertensive treatment. Phentolamine, a com- petitive alpha-receptor blocking agent and clonidine, a centrally sympatholytic agent with additional sedative properties are useful if additional BP-lowering therapy is required. Nicardipine and nitroprusside are suitable alternatives.
- Pheochromocytoma: The adrenergic drive associated with pheochromocytoma responds well to phentolamine. Beta-blockers should only be used once alpha-blockers have been introduced to avoid acceleration of hypertension. Urapidil and nitroprusside are additional suitable options.
- Preeclampsia/eclampsia: See Section 10.3: Hypertension in Pregnancy.

### Follow-Up
Patients who experienced a hypertensive emergency are at increased risk of cardiovascular and renal disease. Thorough investigation of potential underlying causes and assessment of HMOD is mandatory to avoid recurrent presentations with hypertensive emergencies. Similarly, adjustment and simplification of antihypertensive therapy paired with advice for lifestyle modification will assist to improve adherence and long-term BP control. Regular and frequent follow-up (monthly) is recommended until target BP and ideally regression of HMOD has been achieved.
