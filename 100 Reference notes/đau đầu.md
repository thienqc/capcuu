- Patients with a known headache disorder who present with a change in the character of the headache should be evaluated for potential serious causes.
- The physical examination in the headache patient focuses primarily on ==mental status==, ==funduscopic exam==, ==meningeal signs==, and ==neurologic examination==, particularly ==cranial nerves (CNVs) II, III, IV, and VI==, as well as specific cerebral territories. 
- ==Mild to moderate== primary and nonspecific headaches are treated with non- steroidal analgesic drugs (==NSAIDs==). Severe headaches can be managed parenterally with dopamine antagonists (metoclopramide or prochlorper- azine), migraine- specific agents (triptans), or NSAIDS (Ketorolac). Opioid pain medications are not indicated for the treatment of primary headaches.
- ==Most patients with headache do not require neuroimaging.== When obtained, neuroimaging is tailored to the specific elements of concern in the differen- tial diagnosis.
- The differential diagnosis of sudden severe headache includes subarach- noid hemorrhage (SAH) or other intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), cerebral venous thrombosis, and cervical artery dissection (Box 16.1).
- In patients suspected for SAH, a stepwise application of Ottawa SAH Rule, computed tomography (CT) imaging, followed by lumbar puncture (LP) and/ or CT angiography (CTA) is appropriate.
- Antibiotics should be administered prior to performing a LP when bacterial meningitis is suspected.

Headache is consistently among the top reasons for visits to the emergency department (ED). The vast majority of patients who have a primary complaint of headache do not have a serious medical cause for the problem. Most common primary headache etiologies are benign, such as tension headache and migraine. A minority of headaches are caused by underlying medical or surgical conditions that warrant prompt diagnosis and treatment. The low incidence of serious disease can create a “needle in the haystack” phenomenon, and headache is disproportionately represented in emergency medicine malpractice claims despite widespread overuse of imaging for benign headache conditions. Although representing only a small proportion of patients presenting with acute headache to the ED, the most important and commonly encountered life- threatening cause of severe sudden head pain is ==[[SAH]]==.1 Unfortunately, this is a diagnosis that is also missed on ftrst presentation more than 25% of the time.2 The other signiftcant, potentially life-threatening causes of headache occur even less frequently. As is the case for SAH, these other serious disorders (i.e., meningitis, carbon monoxide poisoning, temporal arteritis, acute angleclosure glaucoma, ICH, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and increased intracranial pressure from space- occupying lesions or idiopathic intracranial hypertension [IIH]) can ofien be linked with speciftc historical elements and physical ftndings that facilitate their diagnosis.

The brain parenchyma is insensitive to pain. The pain- sensitive areas of the head include the meninges, the arteries and veins supplying the brain, and the various tissues lining the cavities within the skull. The ability of the patient to speciftcally localize head pain is ofien poor. Much of the pain associated with headache, particularly with vascu- lar headache and migraines, is mediated through the ftfih CNV. Such pain may proceed back to the nucleus and is then referred through various branches of CNV to areas not directly involved. Inffammation in a speciftc structure (e.g., periapical abscess, sinusitis, or trigeminal neuralgia) is much easier to localize than the relatively difluse pain that may be generated by tension or traction headaches. Pain in the head and neck regions may easily overlap and should therefore be thought of as a single unit when complaints of headache are considered.
