Evaluation and Management of Acute Severe Hypertension.
A focused evaluation of the targets of hypertension-mediated organ injury should be performed in every patient. With respect to the brain, inquire about focal motor or sensory deficits and speech or visual changes. Perform a neurologic examination, looking for motor deficits and gait, speech, and visual abnormalities. If there are positive findings, perform imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. With respect to the retina, perform funduscopy or retinal fundus photography, looking for evidence of microvascular injury (hemorrhages or exudates) or cerebral edema (papilledema). With respect to the heart, ask about chest pain, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, and edema. Look for signs of heart failure on examination (elevated jugular venous pressure, bibasilar rales, third heart sound, or edema). Perform chest radiography, electrocardiog- raphy (for ischemic changes), and troponin measurement in most patients. Acute coronary syndromes include un- stable angina and myocardial infarction. With respect to large vessels (aorta), ask about chest or back pain. Obtain blood-pressure measurements in both arms and thigh, looking for asymmetry. If suspicion is aroused, obtain CT of the chest and abdomen with contrast or transesophageal echocardiography. With respect to the kidneys, measure the serum creatinine level to rule out acute kidney injury. Urinalysis may show proteinuria or hematuria as a sign of microvascular injury. With respect to the microvasculature, obtain a complete blood count, looking for anemia and thrombocytopenia suggestive of microangiopathy. ADHF denotes acute decompensated heart failure, IV intravenous, MAHA microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and PRES posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Adapted from Whelton et al.

Cerebral blood flow is relatively stable across a wide blood-pressure range through changes in cerebrovascular resistance. On the high end of the curve, increased cerebrovascular resistance prevents pressure-induced increases in blood flow. Once the upper limit of autoregulation is crossed, small changes in blood pressure produce substantial increases in blood flow that result in vasogenic cerebral edema and its complications. On the low end of the curve, decreased cerebrovascular resistance allows flow to be main- tained despite progressively lower blood pressure. Once the autoregulatory limit is reached, small decreases in blood pressure produce substantial im- pairment in cerebral perfusion. In clinical experiments, the lower limit of autoregulation occurs at blood-pressure levels approximately 25% lower than baseline. Symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion develop when cerebral blood flow falls by more than approximately 30%. There is wide individual variability in autoregulatory limits and thresholds at both ends of the curve. The autoregulatory curve is shifted to the right in uncontrolled hypertension. Treatment of hypertension for weeks to months may improve or correct the autoregulatory abnormalities, especially in patients without long-standing severe hypertension.
